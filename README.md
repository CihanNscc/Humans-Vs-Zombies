# Humans Vs Zombies Simulation

Welcome to the Humans Vs Zombies simulation! This project is a C++ simulation of a hypothetical scenario where humans and zombies interact in a predefined environment. The simulation models the behaviors and interactions between humans and zombies, providing insights into various outcomes based on different initial conditions and rules.

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation**: Models interactions between humans and zombies in real-time.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as the number of humans, zombies, simulation speed, and more.
- **Visualization**: Offers a basic visualization of the simulation.
